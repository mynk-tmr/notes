*Network* : a group of inter-connected computers or other devices

*Server* : A computer or software that processes requests and serve info to other computers on a network. A server using HTTP is called **web server.**

*Website* - a collection of linked web pages with a unique **domain** name

*Packet* - A small unit of data that is transmitted over internet. **Latency** (ms) is time taken to reach its destination. **Bandwith** (bps) is the amount of data transfered per second

*Router* : A device that **directs** **packets** between different networks.
1. **Manages traffic** among networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses
2. Allows multiple devices to use the same **Internet connection.**

It uses an **internal routing table** — a list of paths to various destinations. The router reads a packet's **header** to determine where it is going, then consults the routing table to figure out the most efficient path to that destination. It then forwards the packet to the next network in the path.

*IP Address*: A unique ID assigned to each device on a network. IPv4 is 32bit (192.0.0.1 ⇒ four 8bit no.s). IPv6 is 128bit, uses hex numbers and is faster, cheaper and secure. Machines can use both via dual addressing

*Domain Name:* A human-readable alias for IP address.

*Port:* unique no. that identifies an app or service running on a device. Provided by IANA

*Socket:* combination of IP address and port number, representing a specific endpoint for communication.
