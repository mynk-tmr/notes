## Thinking in React 

1. Break UI into smallest components 
2. code each state (test all) 
	- a data should be *state* if it isn't prop, can't be computed from other data and changes over time. 
3. Create heirarchy tree of components
4. Build a static version of page
5. Decide minimum **state data** that app needs
6. Refactor state into props and contexts when needed
