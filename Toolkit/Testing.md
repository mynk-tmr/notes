Unit testing is a software development technique where you divide software up into smaller isolated parts and write tests for each of those isolated parts to verify that they work as expected 

In order to break larger function into smaller isolated functions, you have to be able to break that function conceptually as well otherwise you are just spreading the problem into different places which increases complexity instead reducing 

ADDITIONAL INFO: In TDD, we write automated tests for the code before that code is written. In Unit testing, we write tests before or while writing ode, or after writing code
