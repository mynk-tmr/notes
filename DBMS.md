*Languages used by DBMS*
- **Data Definition Language (DDL):** commands for defining databases, such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, and RENAME.
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** manipulation in a database using commands like SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, etc.
- **Data Control Language (DCL):** commands manage user permissions and controls within the database system, including GRANT and REVOKE.
- **Transaction Control Language (TCL):** commands to manage database transactions, such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

**Q17: Explain query optimization in DBMS.**

Query optimization is the process of identifying the most efficient plan for evaluating a query, minimizing the estimated cost. It involves selecting the best algorithms and approaches. Query optimization aims to deliver query results faster, handle a larger number of queries in less time, and reduce the complexity of time and space requirements.


**Q37: Define a view in SQL.**

In SQL, a view is a virtual table created from the result set of a SQL statement. It allows users to query the view as if it were a regular table

Views have several uses in a database:
1. represent a subset of data from one or more tables
2. combine and simplify multiple tables 
3. aggregated tables, where the database engine performs aggregate functions (e.g., sum, average) and displays the results alongside the data.
4. *abstraction* of underlying tables
5. occupy minimal storage space since they only store the definition of the view
6. provide additional security by restricting access to specific columns or rows of the underlying tables.

**Q94: What is the difference between a view and a table?**

A table is a storage structure that holds data in a relational database, while a view is a virtual table derived from one or more tables or views. Unlike tables, views do not store data physically but provide a way to query and manipulate data from multiple tables as a single entity.

**Q39: What is a Trigger?**

A trigger is a piece of code associated with write operations on a table. It is automatically executed when the associated query is run. Triggers are used to maintain database integrity by enforcing specific actions or constraints whenever data changes occur.

**Q40: What is a stored procedure?**

A stored procedure consists of a set of pre-defined procedures that are commonly used in applications to perform database-related activities. Stored procedures can be executed with specific parameters and provide a way to encapsulate and reuse code logic within the database.

**Q41: How does a Trigger differ from a Stored Procedure?**

Triggers cannot be directly called, unlike stored procedures. They are only associated with specific queries or actions.

**Q43: What are indexes in a database?**

Indexes in a database are data structures designed to improve speed of data retrieval operations on tables. They trade off increased writes and storage space for faster access to data. Indexes allow for quicker searches by organizing and storing data in a specific order.

**Q44: Differentiate between clustered and non-clustered indexes.**

Clustered indexes determine the physical order in which data is stored on a disk. Each database table can have only one clustered index. Non-clustered indexes establish logical ordering of data rather than physical ordering. They often involve the creation of tree structures, such as B-trees or B+ trees, where leaves point to disk records.

**Q46: What is a clause in SQL?**

In SQL, a clause is a component of a query that allows for filtering or customizing the data being queried. It helps specify conditions or actions to be applied to the data.


**Q49: Why are cursors necessary in embedded SQL?**

Cursors are used in embedded SQL to store the result of a query, allowing application programs to process the data row by row. SQL statements operate on sets of data and return another set of data, while host language programs typically work with data one row at a time. Cursors enable traversal through a set of rows generated by a [](https://www.almabetter.com/bytes/tutorials/sql/select-statement-in-sql)SQL SELECT statement within the code, acting as a pointer for efficient row-by-row processing.


**Q52: What is the purpose of SQL?**

Ans. SQL serves as a language used to interact with relational databases. Its primary purpose is to perform operations such as querying, updating, and modifying data in the database.

Ans. A subquery/ inner query is nested within another query. It is used to retrieve data based on result of another query.

Ans. A correlated subquery is executed for each row of outer query. It is a nested query where the inner query depends on the values from the outer query.


**Q69: Differentiate between a 2-tier and 3-tier architecture in a DBMS.**

A 2-tier architecture involves direct interaction between client applications and the database server. In contrast, a 3-tier architecture adds an intermediary layer, providing a GUI and enhanced security


**Q71: What are temporary tables and when are they beneficial?**

Temporary tables are tables that are used for a single session or for the duration of a transaction. They are commonly used to support unique rollups or specific application processing needs. Unlike permanent tables, temporary tables do not have pre-allocated space and dynamically allocate space as rows are added.


**Q85: What is the concept of Fill Factor in relation to indexes?**

Fill Factor refers to the percentage of space left on each leaf-level page of an index that is densely packed with data. The default value is typically 100, indicating full packing of index data.

**Q86: What is Index Tuning and how does it enhance query performance?**

Index Tuning involves optimizing a set of indexes to improve query performance and query processing time. It helps in query performance enhancement through:
- Suggesting optimal queries using query optimizers.
- Measuring the impact with indices, query distribution, and performance metrics.
- Optimizing databases for a small number of frequently executed queries.


**HAVING clause** is used to filter rows in a SELECT statement based on conditions applied to groups defined by the GROUP BY clause. It is similar to the WHERE clause but operates on grouped data rather than individual rows. WHERE clause cannot contain aggregate functions, while the HAVING clause is specifically designed for such purposes.

DELETE command is used to remove specific rows from a table based on conditions specified in the WHERE clause. 
TRUNCATE command is used to delete all data from a table without conditions.


**Q56: How is the DROP command used, and what are the differences between DROP, TRUNCATE, and DELETE commands?**

DROP -> delete an existing table, database, index, or view from a database. DROP removes the entire table structure, while TRUNCATE deletes all rows from a table but keeps the structure intact.

DELETE allows the operation to be rolled back (undo), while DROP and TRUNCATE cannot be undone.
