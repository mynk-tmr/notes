Web accessibility — websites, tools, and technologies are designed to have as few barriers as possible.

**Customisable Text** 
- Using *relative units* for fonts and controls
- compatible with OS or browser text setting
- Help users change their settings

**Large Links, Buttons and Controls** — Large activation areas, adequate separation, provide labels for controls

**Feedback** — Display Error description and fix. Provide confirmation on form submission. When new content is added to screen, alert users.

**Keyboard Compatibility** 
- key controls for links, buttons, and form elements,
- key controls for any custom made controls
- Logical TAB order
- Provide a way for users to jump between blocks of content and controls.

**Video Captions** — voice recognition software built into site.
**Colors with Good Contrast** — choose during early design stage. Avoid flashy or over-bright colors.

**Clear Layout and Design**
- different parts must be easy to locate and identify e.g. menus, links, and text sections.
- consistent design. Items at predictable locations and consistently identified.
- provide headers to identify groups of info

**Form Controls**
- group related controls with labels and instructions
- labels and identifiers for controls in the source code match their visual presentation (so Alexa can easily control them)

**Text to Speech** — Provide text alternatives for images, icons, and other non-text content.
