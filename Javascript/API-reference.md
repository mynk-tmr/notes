## Concepts

[same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) means that a script can only request resources from the same origin it was loaded from (ie. server). To bypass this, we enable **CORS** 

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** ([CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS)) is an [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP)-header based mechanism that allows a *server* to indicate any *origins* other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources
